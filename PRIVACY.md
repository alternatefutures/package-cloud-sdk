# Privacy Policy

## Our Commitment

Alternate Futures is committed to user privacy and data sovereignty. This SDK is designed with privacy-first principles and censorship resistance.

## Data Collection

### What We DON'T Collect

This SDK does **NOT** collect:
- Usage analytics
- Telemetry data
- Error reports
- User behavior tracking
- Device information
- IP addresses
- Location data
- Performance metrics

### What We DO Collect

The SDK only transmits data you explicitly request:
- API calls you initiate
- Data you choose to upload or store
- Authentication tokens you provide

All communication is directly between your application and Alternate Futures services. We are not a middleman.

## Data Storage

### Your Content

- **Decentralized Storage**: Content uploaded via this SDK is stored on IPFS and Arweave
- **No Central Server**: Your files are distributed across decentralized networks
- **Cryptographic Verification**: All content is cryptographically hashed and verifiable
- **Immutability**: Once published to IPFS/Arweave, content cannot be modified (only versioned)

### Metadata

Metadata associated with your projects (sites, domains, functions) is stored in our GraphQL backend:
- Project configurations
- Domain DNS records
- Function deployment settings
- Access control lists

This metadata is necessary for service operation and is stored securely.

## Authentication

### Personal Access Tokens

- Tokens are generated by you through the Alternate Futures CLI or web interface
- Tokens are stored locally in your application configuration
- Tokens are never logged or transmitted except to our authentication service
- You can revoke tokens at any time

### Token Storage Best Practices

We recommend:
- Store tokens in environment variables or secure key management systems
- Never commit tokens to version control
- Use separate tokens for different applications
- Rotate tokens regularly

## Third-Party Services

This SDK communicates with:

1. **Alternate Futures GraphQL API**: Manages projects, sites, domains, functions
2. **Alternate Futures IPFS Gateway**: Uploads and pins content to IPFS
3. **IPFS Network**: Decentralized file storage
4. **Arweave Network**: Permanent decentralized storage

We do not integrate with analytics services, advertising networks, or tracking platforms.

## Censorship Resistance

### Multi-Gateway Support

Content is accessible through multiple gateways:
- Official Alternate Futures gateways
- Public IPFS gateways
- Self-hosted IPFS nodes
- Arweave gateways

If one gateway is blocked, content remains accessible through others.

### Content Addressing

All content is addressed by cryptographic hash (CID), not by domain:
- `ipfs://QmHash...` for IPFS content
- `ar://txid...` for Arweave content

This makes censorship at the DNS level ineffective.

## Data Retention

### User-Controlled Retention

- **IPFS**: Content is pinned as long as you maintain your account
- **Arweave**: Content is permanent and cannot be deleted
- **Metadata**: Retained until you delete your account

### Account Deletion

Upon account deletion:
- Metadata is removed from our databases
- IPFS pins are removed (content may persist on IPFS network)
- Arweave content remains permanent (by design)
- Authentication tokens are immediately invalidated

## Regional Considerations

### No Geo-Blocking

We do not restrict access based on:
- Geographic location
- IP address
- Country of origin

### Data Sovereignty

Because content is decentralized:
- No single jurisdiction controls your data
- Content is replicated globally
- You maintain cryptographic ownership

## Open Source Transparency

This SDK is open source (GPLv3):
- Source code is publicly auditable
- No hidden telemetry or tracking
- Community can verify our privacy claims
- Fork and self-host if desired

## Changes to This Policy

We will notify users of privacy policy changes through:
- GitHub releases
- Changelog updates
- Major version bumps (if breaking changes)

## Contact

Privacy questions: privacy@alternatefutures.ai
Security concerns: security@alternatefutures.ai
General support: support@alternatefutures.ai

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Access your data
- Export your data
- Delete your account
- Request information about data processing
- File complaints with relevant authorities

## Compliance

We comply with:
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- Other applicable privacy laws

Because we collect minimal data, compliance is straightforward.
